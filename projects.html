            <i>Description: Compare firms that have been selected as AI-intensive to other firms within the same industry on a variety of risk measures. AI Intensive firms will be identified by their inclusion in the BlueStar Artificial Intelligence Index or the Global Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Thematic Index. This was done by extracting data for both Indexes using Compustat - Capital IQ. Furthermore, the data was organized using Microsoft office by their dates of establishment, their yearly income, etc. This step was essential for comparing the measure of risk used for companies that implement AI vs companies who don't use AI.</i>

We research the fundamental off how to calculate fuzzy number to better understand fuzzy logic. The was done by reviewing literature summaries related to the topic. This further helped us understand the essence of mapping and drawing out fuzzy logic diagrams.</i>
